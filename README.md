# Information-Retrieval
Information Storage and Retrieval



1. Basic Python File: Basic python understanding and http content parsing
2. Lyrical Search Engine:
  Implemented the following:
  a. Basic Tokenizations using Lemmatization
  b. Zipf's Law
  c. Boolean Retrieval
  d. TF-IDF (with and without cosine similarity scoring)
  e. BM25 ranking
  f. A cool extension on my own- Implementation of Positional indexing to support phrase queries and proof of its implementation correctness via different use-cases
  
3. Recommendations with Implicit Feedback
  a. Non-Personalized Method for Implicit Recommendation
  b. User-User Collaborative Filtering using N-nearest neighbor/N most similar users (N=10) for Implicit Recommendation
  c. Matrix Factorization using Gradient descent for implicit recommendation
  d. Bayesian Personalized Ranking(BPR) for Implicit Recommendation
  e. A cool extension on my own- Analysis of the varying the value of Latent Factor K on the efficiency of BPR, finding the optimal K for given dataset and analysing the reason behind it using the below trend I got from my experiments.
